### Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq Dataset

**Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository

**Description**: This dataset comprises RNA-Seq gene expression profiles from patients with different types of tumors. It is used for the classification of cancer types based on gene expression patterns.

**Contents**:
- **Samples**: The dataset includes samples from patients with various forms of tumors.
- **Features**: Gene expression levels, represented numerically, are the primary features in this dataset.
- **Applications**: Ideal for training machine learning models to classify types of cancer. Also useful for exploratory data analysis in cancer genomics.

**Usage**: This dataset serves as a foundational tool for understanding cancer genomics, enabling the development and testing of algorithms for cancer classification based on gene expression data.
